There has been a large amount of work on automatic parameter choice, 
especially for regularization parameters in various regression algorithms 
\cite{CI12},\cite{GEE10},\cite{BBGH07}. However, many of these results depend on assuming some 
underlying structure in the data, and exploiting that in order to provide 
analytic techniques that compute the optimal or near-optimal choice of 
parameter. Many of these automatic tuning algorithms are also extremely 
application-specific. 

To our knowledge, there is no general framework for automating parameter 
choice that can be applied independent of algorithm or task. In this work 
we propose a system to optimize parameters that depends only on the input 
and output of the algorithm. Our system does not assume any underlying 
data model, and only uses its own history to estimate optimal parameters. 
This approach may give worse results than the model approach if the model 
is carefully chosen, but this is not always possible, and it does not
allow for changes to the data over time.
