For testing and evaluation of our optimizer we implemented several variants of the DFC (Divide-Factor-Combine) framework for distributed matrix completion, originally introduced in \cite{Ameet}. The DFC framework is used to solve the following well-studied matrix completion problem: Let $A$ be an unknown $m\times n$ matrix of rank $r$, and assume $r<<m,n$. Next $A'$ is obtained by adding a small amount of noise to every entry of $A$. Finally, a small fraction (e.g. $10\%$) of the entries of $A'$ are revealed. The goal is then to find a low-rank matrix $B$ that is a good approximation of the original matrix $A$, using only the revealed entries of $A'$.

A version of this problem is actually solved in practice by online movie-recommendation systems. Here the matrix has rows corresponding to users and columns corresponding to movies.
